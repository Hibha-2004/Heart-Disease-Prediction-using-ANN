# Heart Disease Prediction using ANN 

## Project Overview
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes. The model is trained on healthcare data and helps in early detection and risk assessment.

## Objective
To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts heart disease using patient health parameters.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection
- ANN model training
- Model evaluation and accuracy calculation
- Prediction on new data

## Dataset
The dataset contains medical attributes such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Blood pressure
- Cholesterol level
- Heart rate
- Other clinical parameters

## Model
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with:
- Input layer
- Hidden layers
- Output layer (Binary classification)

## Result
The model successfully predicts the presence of heart disease with good accuracy.
